## Contents 📁

- `therapy_cancer_dl.py`  
  Uses a **Deep Learning neural network** to predict the best **cancer treatment** based on features like tumor size, lymph nodes, age, and genetic markers.

- `therapy_diabetes_rf.py`  
  Predicts **diabetes treatment** using a **Random Forest** model with inputs such as age, BMI, HbA1c levels, diabetes duration, and complications.

- `therapy_hypertension_simple.py`  
  A **simple rule-based system** recommending hypertension treatment based on **systolic and diastolic blood pressure** values.

- `therapy_rl_dqn.py`  
  Implements a **Reinforcement Learning (Q-learning)** environment and agent to optimize **HIV treatment** strategies with training visualization.
